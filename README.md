# react-blog
Blog site

    It was a first project, with merely an HTML skeleton. Because I didn't know how to utilise CSS at the time, everything had a pixel-perfect background. This was ineffective, looked awful, was barely functional, and everything had to fall into place by accident. When it comes to responsive design, the situation was considerably worse.
    Amidst the failure after failure, I was determined to learn CSS so that I could transform a dead, blank screen into a completely responsive, Netflix-themed home page. It took me a day to learn CSS from the ground up while also working on my personal website.
    The first day after learning CSS was spent conducting market research and developing a colour scheme, as well as modifying and executing the initial wireframe. The opening page alone looked a million times better than it had previously. The following day was spent generating CSS animations, which provide a notable creative touch to the page. On Day 3, I improved everything by deleting some unneeded code and added the moving stars in the background to keep the viewer's attention and keep them on the website. This was also a good place to start studying JavaScript.
    The background, ironically, aroused my interest in JavaScript, motivating me to study it and employ its features on HTML and CSS. The fourth day was solely dedicated to learning JavaScript. To improve my abilities, I found a website called codewars, which led me to React. There will be more on React. This website is always developing, I am certain that, in time, I will be able to replicate current pages using simply JavaScript rather than HTML and CSS or HTML and JavaScript.
    In summary, this site began on October 8, 2021 and completed on October 25, 2021, a 17-day, 12-hour-day effort that taught me how to utilise HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to the point where I can make pages that look fantastic while keeping their functionality. In terms of commercial use, I am convinced that with cleaner, reusable code, I could develop a completely responsive company website much more quickly.

    Postscript

    Because this was the fourth iteration of the website, it was given the name react-blog because I attempted to develop version 2 using only react. It was much easier to utilise HTML and CSS because JavaScript Extention generated several problems that caused conflict unless I restarted it with a different wireframe. Currently, the website does not need to be dynamic because the visitor's curiosity must be piqued so that they may rapidly move through the parts. When there are modest delays with animations with simple things like buttons or opening a list to traverse the page, I find that the user is frequently annoyed.
